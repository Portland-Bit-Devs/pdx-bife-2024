## What to Expect

Our events are structured to offer an immersive experience that delves into various technical aspects, promoting collaboration and exploration
within the realm of Bitcoin and associated protocols.

## Technical Discussions

The first half of each session is dedicated to delving into technical components, such as exploring pull requests in Bitcoin Core,
lnd (Lightning Network Daemon), network statistics analysis, dissecting research papers, dissecting technical blog posts, and
engaging with other relevant technical content. This segment serves as an arena for participants to exchange insights, pose questions,
and engage in deep technical discussions.

## Educational Sessions

In the second half, our sessions broaden to encompass educational discussions, often presented in the form of fireside chats or
interactive presentations. These discussions touch on broader concepts, offering a holistic view of Bitcoin technology, and encourage
participation from diverse perspectives. Following the presentation, we open the floor to feedback and Q&A sessions, fostering an
inclusive environment for learning and sharing knowledge.

companies, present ongoing research, or present any other relevant materials contributing to the advancement of Bitcoin technology.
