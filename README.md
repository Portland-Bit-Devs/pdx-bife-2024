# pdx-bife-2024

Portland Bitcoin Is For Everyone Conference 2024

## Information


## Development

Site is developed using NPM 8.x, Node v16.20.2, and Angular 16.2.0 with SCSS styling.

NOTE: Considering using deployment to Azure storage account instead of GitHub pages: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions?tabs=userlevel

To deploy, you must first run `npm run build` locally, then check in the changes.   Once the changes are checked in, then you need to manually
  trigger the `pages-build-deploymen` action in the Github project to actually deploy the site.
